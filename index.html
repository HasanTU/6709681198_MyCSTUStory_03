                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am someone who enjoys innovations related to modern technology.
                    I have a keen interest in technology and am observant by nature.
                    My curiosity for discovering new things and my ability to observe
                    have allowed me to recognize various problems within my own
                    community. These issues include educational challenges and the
                    lack of opportunities for underprivileged children. These problems
                    persist around me, and over time, I’ve set a life goal for myself:
                    to bring about change here, to lead opportunities to this place,
                    because this is my hometown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve asked myself what I truly want to be. This led me to explore my
                    own identity by participating in various activities. Eventually,
                    I joined project competitions related to applying technology, whether
                    it’s Artificial Intelligence, Arduino, or developing different
                    applications. These experiences have ignited my passion and fulfilled
                    my dreams. Due to the lack of institutions teaching these skills in
                    my province, I’ve had to self-study through online resources like
                    Google, YouTube, and even by asking questions in programming groups
                    on Facebook. Despite occasional obstacles in my learning journey,
                    I’ve never given up. I continue to seek knowledge and hone my skills.
                    I always tell myself that I won’t stop here—I’ll keep developing myself.
                    My ultimate goal is to contribute to the growth of Narathiwat, my
                    hometown, whether it’s through educational opportunities or other means.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why Thammasat? Because Thammasat is the university of giving and opportunity.
                    Thammasat empowers people, encourages them to do what’s right, and
                    provides freedom—both in expression and attire. Even though it grants
                    freedom, it remains within the boundaries of what is just.
